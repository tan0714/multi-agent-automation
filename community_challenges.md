### Build an AI Agent for YouTube Channel Performance Insights
**Task**: Develop an AI agent that integrates with YouTube‚Äôs Analytics, Reporting, and Data APIs to automatically retrieve and analyze video and channel performance data. The agent should provide creators with a conversational interface where they can ask questions (e.g., "What are my top-performing videos this month?") and receive actionable insights and recommendations‚Äîsuch as optimal posting times, title improvements, or thumbnail suggestions‚Äîto improve engagement and overall channel strategy.


**Success Criteria**:
- The agent successfully authenticates with and retrieves real-time and historical data from YouTube‚Äôs APIs (views, watch time, retention, engagement).
- Creators can interact naturally with the agent to receive clear responses, including actionable recommendations (e.g., posting times, title improvements).

**Hints**:
- Review YouTube API docs and use NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy or GPT-based models) to build the conversational interface.
