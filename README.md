# Multi-Agent Automation for Polygon

Extend to power AI agents in the Polygon ecosystem.

## Core Capabilities

### Decentralized Data Storage & RAG
- IPFS-backed vector stores for proposals, docs and off-chain state  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines for context-aware drafting and Q&A  

### Agent Orchestration
- Modular “skills” (e.g. proposal drafting, review, community support)  
- Stateful workflows with task queues, retries and approval gates  

### On-Chain Integration
- **Proposal Registry**: anchor IPFS hashes in a registry contract; fetch active submissions via RPC  
- **Governance Hooks**: listen for new proposals, vote periods and live tallies  
- **Eligibility Checks**: verify token/NFT holdings or SBT attributes for roles  
- **Milestone Tracking**: watch `milestoneApproved` events and trigger off-chain workflows  
- **Transparency Anchoring**: publish audit logs and final decisions as on-chain events  

## Roadmap
- **v1**: IPFS + Pinecone integration; simple RAG QA agent  
- **v2**: Polygon RPC & proposal-registry support; metadata anchoring  
- **v3**: Automated proposal drafting; vote monitoring; milestone-driven workflows
