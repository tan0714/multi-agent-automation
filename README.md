# Multi-Agent Automation for Polygon Grants

Extend to power AI agents in the Polygon grants ecosystem.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Decentralized Data Storage & RAG**  
   - IPFS-backed vector stores for docs, proposals, and off-chain state  
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines for up-to-date context  

2. **Agent Orchestration**  
   - Modular “skills” (e.g. grant sourcing, code review, community Q&A)  
   - Stateful workflows with task queues and retries  

3. **On-Chain Integration**  
   - Read/write smart-contract calls 
   - Automated grant application submissions and milestone tracking  
   - Event listeners for token transfers, governance votes, and grant updates  

## Roadmap

- **v1**: IPFS + Pinecone integration; simple RAG QA agent  
- **v2**: Polygon tx builder; automated grant proposals  
- **v3**: Governance bot; on-chain payment disbursement; cross-chain bridges
